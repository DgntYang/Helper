# Helper

### This repository is temporarily used to store repetitive works frequently applied in my researches, in order to reduce the resistance of subsequent work.
First commit contains:
1. save checkpoints
2. backup related codes(.py, .sh, .yaml ~)
3. create folder name according to hyper params set in the experiments
4. adjust learning rate (although rarely used in my codes ...)
5. loading
